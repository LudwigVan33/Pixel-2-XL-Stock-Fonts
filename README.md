## Description 
Systemless adds Pixel 2 XL Stock Fonts.
As far as I can see Pixel Fonts is a combination of Roboto and Google Sans, I tried to emulate it but there's text that shouldn't be Google Sans/Roboto. If you have a way to do it whit better results or know how exactly works fonts on Pixel phones please let me know whit a issue.
